# RockPaperScissors
This was my very first serious project from TheOdinProject. For part 1 of the project we just had to play the game using the prompt function and the console.
For part 2 , we had to create a UI and give "users" a real feel to the game. I went for a really basic black and white interface. This was my first time encountering loops and event listener. It's a pretty good first project to get a your foot into Javascript.
